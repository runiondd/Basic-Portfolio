             I was born in Ohio and went to a very small high school in Amish country.  Undergraduate in MIS from Bowling Green State University, and an MBA from Ohio State University.  I started my career as a web developer coding classic ASP and javaScript then moving to C# and ASP.NET.  Then I got out of coding and spent the next 10 years as a Business Analyst, Product Manager, and even ran an IT PMO for a while. <br/><br/>
             I have a dog, am passionate about health & fitness, and have a healthy addition to anything with wheels.  At one time I owned 4 motorcycles, but I've got that down to 1 and a half (it's a long term project).
